\title{Compute results to a file}
\usage{
compute_parquet(x, path, ..., funnel = NULL, options = NULL)

compute_csv(x, path, ..., funnel = NULL, options = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, data frame extension (e.g. a tibble), or a lazy
data frame (e.g. from dbplyr or dtplyr). See \emph{Methods}, below, for more
details.}

\item{path}{The path to store the result in.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{funnel}{Set to \code{TRUE} to return a funneled or \code{FALSE} to return an unfunneled data frame,
see the "Funneling" section.
The default is to inherit the funnelness of the input.}

\item{options}{A list of additional options to pass to create the storage format,
see \url{https://duckdb.org/docs/data/parquet/overview#writing-to-parquet-files}
or \url{https://duckdb.org/docs/data/csv/overview#writing-using-the-copy-statement}
for details.}

\description{
These functions apply to (funneled) duckplyr frames.
They executes a query and stores the results in a flat file.
The result is a duckplyr frame that can be used with subsequent dplyr verbs.

\code{compute_parquet()} creates a Parquet file.

\code{compute_csv()} creates a CSV file.

\section{Funneling}{

Data frames backed by duckplyr, \code{"duckplyr_df"}, behave as regular data frames in almost all respects.
In particular, direct column access like \code{df$x},
or retrieving the number of rows with \code{\link[=nrow]{nrow()}}, works identically.

A key difference is that for a duckplyr frame that is the result of a dplyr operation,
accessing column data or retrieving the number of rows will trigger a computation
that is carried out by DuckDB, not dplyr.

Another difference is that duckplyr frames can be safer to use with bigger data
thanks to \emph{funneling}.
Funneling duckplyr frames differ in their behavior for column access and row count.
\itemize{
\item For unfunneled duckplyr frames, the underlying DuckDB computation is carried out
upon the first request.
Once the results are computed, they are cached and subsequent requests are fast.
This is a good choice for small to medium-sized data,
where DuckDB can provide a nice speedup but materializing the data is affordable.
This is the default for \code{duckdb_tibble()} and \code{as_duckdb_tibble()}.
\item For funneled duckplyr frames, accessing a column or requesting the number of rows
triggers an error.
This is a good choice for large data sets where the cost of materializing the data
may be prohibitive due to size or computation time,
and the user wants to control when the computation is carried out.
This is the default for the ingestion functions like \code{\link[=read_parquet_duckdb]{read_parquet_duckdb()}}.
It is safe to use \code{read_parquet_duckdb(funnel = FALSE)}
if the data is small enough to be materialized at any stage.
}

Funneled duckplyr frames behave like \href{https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/lazy_dt.html}{\code{dtplyr}'s lazy frames},
or dbplyr's lazy frames:
the computation only starts when you \strong{explicitly} request it with a "collect"
function.
In dtplyr and dbplyr, there are no unfunneled frames: collection always needs to be
explicit.

A funneled duckplyr frame can be converted to an unfunneled one with \code{as_duckdb_tibble(funnel = FALSE)}.
The \code{\link[=collect.duckplyr_df]{collect.duckplyr_df()}} method triggers computation and converts to a plain tibble.
Other useful methods include \code{\link[=compute_file]{compute_file()}} for storing results in a file,
and \code{\link[=compute.duckplyr_df]{compute.duckplyr_df()}} for storing results in temporary storage on disk.

Beyond safety regarding memory usage, funneled frames also allow you
to check that all operations are supported by DuckDB:
for a funneled frame, fallbacks to dplyr are not possible.
As a reminder, computing via DuckDB is currently not always possible,
see \code{vignette("limits")} for the supported operations.
In such cases, the original dplyr implementation is used, see \link{fallback} for details.
As the original dplyr implementation accesses columns directly,
the data must be materialized before a fallback can be executed.
This means that automatic fallback is only possible for "unfunneled" duckplyr frames,
while for "funneled" duckplyr frames, one of the aforementioned collection methods must be used first.
