\description{
Provides a variant of \code{nycflights13::flights} that is compatible with duckplyr,
as a tibble:
the timezone has been set to UTC to work around a current limitation of duckplyr, see \code{vignette("limits")}.
Call \code{\link[=as_duckdb_tibble]{as_duckdb_tibble()}} to enable duckplyr operations.
