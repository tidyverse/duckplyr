\usage{
\method{compute}{duckplyr_df}(
  x,
  ...,
  funnel = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  schema_name = NULL,
  temporary = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, data frame extension (e.g. a tibble), or a lazy
data frame (e.g. from dbplyr or dtplyr). See \emph{Methods}, below, for more
details.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to methods}

\item{funnel}{Set to \code{TRUE} to return a funneled or \code{FALSE} to return an unfunneled data frame,
see the "Funneling" section.
The default is to inherit the funnelness of the input.}

\item{name}{The name of the table to store the result in.}

\item{schema_name}{The schema to store the result in, defaults to the current schema.}

\item{temporary}{Set to \code{FALSE} to store the result in a permanent table.}
}
\description{
This is a method for the \code{\link[dplyr:compute]{dplyr::compute()}} generic.
For a (funneled) duckplyr frame,
\code{compute()} executes a query but stores it in a (temporary) table,
or in a Parquet or CSV file.
The result is a duckplyr frame that can be used with subsequent dplyr verbs.

\section{Funneling}{

Data frames backed by duckplyr, with class \code{"duckplyr_df"},
behave as regular data frames in almost all respects.
In particular, direct column access like \code{df$x},
or retrieving the number of rows with \code{\link[=nrow]{nrow()}}, works identically.
Conceptually, duckplyr frames are "eager": from a user's perspective,
they behave like regular data frames.
Under the hood, two key differences provide improved performance and usability:
lazy materialization and funneling.

For a duckplyr frame that is the result of a dplyr operation,
accessing column data or retrieving the number of rows will trigger a computation
that is carried out by DuckDB, not dplyr.
In this sense, duckplyr frames are also "lazy":
the computation is deferred until the last possible moment,
allowing DuckDB to optimize the whole pipeline.
This is similar to lazy tables in \pkg{dbplyr} and \pkg{dtplyr},
but different from \pkg{dplyr} where each intermediate step is computed.

Being both "eager" and "lazy" at the same time introduces a challenge:
it is too easy to accidentally trigger computation,
which may be prohibitive if an intermediate result is too large.
This is where funneling comes in.
\itemize{
\item For unfunneled duckplyr frames, the underlying DuckDB computation is carried out
upon the first request.
Once the results are computed, they are cached and subsequent requests are fast.
This is a good choice for small to medium-sized data,
where DuckDB can provide a nice speedup but materializing the data is affordable
at any stage.
This is the default for \code{duckdb_tibble()} and \code{as_duckdb_tibble()}.
\item For funneled duckplyr frames, accessing a column or requesting the number of rows
triggers an error, either unconditionally, or if the result exceeds a certain size.
This is a good choice for large data sets where the cost of materializing the data
may be prohibitive due to size or computation time,
and the user wants to control when the computation is carried out.
The default for the ingestion functions like \code{\link[=read_parquet_duckdb]{read_parquet_duckdb()}}
is to limit the result size to one million cells (values in the resulting data frame).
}

Funneled duckplyr frames behave like \href{https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/lazy_dt.html}{\code{dtplyr}'s lazy frames},
or dbplyr's lazy frames:
the computation only starts when you \strong{explicitly} request it with a "collect"
function.
In dtplyr and dbplyr, there are no unfunneled frames: collection always needs to be
explicit.

A funneled duckplyr frame can be converted to an unfunneled one with \code{as_duckdb_tibble(funnel = FALSE)}.
The \code{\link[=collect.duckplyr_df]{collect.duckplyr_df()}} method triggers computation and converts to a plain tibble.
Other useful methods include \code{\link[=compute_file]{compute_file()}} for storing results in a file,
and \code{\link[=compute.duckplyr_df]{compute.duckplyr_df()}} for storing results in temporary storage on disk.

Beyond safety regarding memory usage, funneled frames also allow you
to check that all operations are supported by DuckDB:
for a funneled frame with \code{funnel = FALSE}, fallbacks to dplyr are not possible.
As a reminder, computing via DuckDB is currently not always possible,
see \code{vignette("limits")} for the supported operations.
In such cases, the original dplyr implementation is used, see \link{fallback} for details.
As the original dplyr implementation accesses columns directly,
the data must be materialized before a fallback can be executed.
This means that automatic fallback is only possible for "unfunneled" duckplyr frames,
while for "funneled" duckplyr frames, one of the aforementioned collection methods must be used first.
