\description{
The \pkg{duckplyr} package aims at providing
a fully compatible drop-in replacement for \pkg{dplyr}.
To achieve this, only a carefully selected subset of \pkg{dplyr}'s operations,
R functions, and R data types are implemented.
Whenever a request cannot be handled by DuckDB,
\pkg{duckplyr} falls back to \pkg{dplyr}.
See \verb{vignette("fallback"})` for details.

To assist future development, the fallback situations can be logged
to the console or to a local file and uploaded for analysis.
By default, \pkg{duckplyr} will not log or upload anything.
The functions and environment variables on this page control the process.

\code{fallback_sitrep()} prints the current settings for fallback printing, logging,
and uploading, the number of reports ready for upload, and the location of the logs.

\code{fallback_config()} configures the current settings for fallback printing,
logging, and uploading.
Only settings that do not affect computation results can be configured,
this is by design.
The configuration is stored in a file under \code{tools::R_user_dir("duckplyr", "config")} .
When the \pkg{duckplyr} package is loaded, the configuration is read from this file,
and the corresponding environment variables are set.

\code{fallback_review()} prints the available reports for review to the console.

\code{fallback_upload()} uploads the available reports to a central server for analysis.
The server is hosted on AWS and the reports are stored in a private S3 bucket.
Only authorized personnel have access to the reports.

\code{fallback_purge()} deletes some or all available reports.
}
\details{
Logging is on by default, but can be turned off.
Uploading is opt-in.

The following environment variables control the logging and uploading:
\itemize{
\item \code{DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_INFO} controls human-friendly alerts
for fallback events.
If \code{TRUE}, a message is printed when a fallback to dplyr occurs
because DuckDB cannot handle a request.
These messages are never logged.
\item \code{DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT} controls logging, set it
to 1 or greater to enable logging.
If the value is 0, logging is disabled.
Future versions of \pkg{duckplyr} may start logging additional data
and thus require a higher value to enable logging.
Set to 99 to enable logging for all future versions.
Use \code{\link[usethis:edit]{usethis::edit_r_environ()}} to edit the environment file.
\item \code{DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_AUTOUPLOAD} controls uploading, set it
to 1 or greater to enable uploading.
If the value is 0, uploading is disabled.
Currently, uploading is active if the value is 1 or greater.
Future versions of \pkg{duckplyr} may start logging additional data
and thus require a higher value to enable uploading.
Set to 99 to enable uploading for all future versions.
Use \code{\link[usethis:edit]{usethis::edit_r_environ()}} to edit the environment file.
\item \code{DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_LOG_DIR} controls the location of the logs.
It must point to a directory (existing or not) where the logs will be written.
By default, logs are written to a directory in the user's cache directory
as returned by \code{tools::R_user_dir("duckplyr", "cache")}.
\item \code{DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_VERBOSE} controls printing of log data, set it
to \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} to enable or disable printing.
If the value is \code{TRUE}, a message is printed to the console
for each fallback situation.
This setting is only relevant if logging is enabled,
and mostly useful for \pkg{duckplyr}'s internal tests.
