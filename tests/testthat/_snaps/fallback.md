    Message
      The duckplyr package is configured to fall back to dplyr when it encounters an incompatibility. Fallback events can be collected and uploaded for analysis to guide future development. By default, no data will be collected or uploaded.
      i Fallback logging is not controlled and therefore disabled. Enable it with `Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = 1)`, disable it with `Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = 0)`.
      i Fallback uploading is not controlled and therefore disabled. Enable it with `Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_AUTOUPLOAD = 1)`, disable it with `Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_AUTOUPLOAD = 0)`.
      i See `?duckplyr::fallback()` for details.
