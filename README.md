> A **drop-in replacement** for dplyr, powered by DuckDB for **fast
> operation**.

[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is the grammar of data
manipulation in the tidyverse. The duckplyr package will run all of your
existing dplyr code with identical results, using
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) where possible to compute the results
faster. In addition, you can analyze larger-than-memory datasets
straight from files on your disk or from S3 storage. If you are new to
dplyr, the best place to start is the [data transformation
chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) in R for Data Science.

## Installation

Install duckplyr from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr")
```

You can also install the development version of duckplyr from
[R-universe](https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev/builds):

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr", repos = c("https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Or from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))
pak::pak("tidyverse/duckplyr")
```

## Example

``` r
library(conflicted)
library(dplyr)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
library(duckplyr)
```

Calling `library(duckplyr)` overwrites dplyr methods, enabling duckplyr
instead for the entire session. To turn this off, call
`methods_restore()`.

See also the companion [demo
repository](https://github.com/Tmonster/duckplyr_demo) for a use case
with a large dataset.

This example illustrates usage of duckplyr for all data frames in the R
session (“session-wide”).

Use `library(duckplyr)` or `duckplyr::methods_overwrite()` to overwrite
dplyr methods and enable processing with duckdb for all data frames:

``` r
duckplyr::methods_overwrite()
```

``` r
out <-
  palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  # CAVEAT: factor columns are not supported yet
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character)) %>%
  mutate(bill_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(.by = c(species, sex), mean_bill_area = mean(bill_area)) %>%
  filter(species != "Gentoo")
```

The result is a plain tibble now:

``` r
class(out)
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

Querying the number of rows also starts the computation:

``` r
nrow(out)
#> [1] 5
```

Restart R, or call `duckplyr::methods_restore()` to revert to the
default dplyr implementation.

``` r
duckplyr::methods_restore()
#> ℹ Restoring dplyr methods.
```

dplyr is active again:

``` r
palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  # CAVEAT: factor columns are not supported yet
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character)) %>%
  mutate(bill_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(.by = c(species, sex), mean_bill_area = mean(bill_area)) %>%
  filter(species != "Gentoo")
#> # A tibble: 5 × 3
#>   species   sex    mean_bill_area
#>   <chr>     <chr>           <dbl>
#> 1 Adelie    male             770.
#> 2 Adelie    female           657.
#> 3 Adelie    NA                NA 
#> 4 Chinstrap female           820.
#> 5 Chinstrap male             984.
```

## Using duckplyr in other packages

Refer to `vignette("developers", package = "duckplyr")`.

## Telemetry

We would like to guide our efforts towards improving duckplyr, focusing
on the features with the most impact. To this end, duckplyr collects and
uploads telemetry data, but only if permitted by the user:

- No collection will happen unless the user explicitly opts in.
- Uploads are done upon request only.
- There is an option to automatically upload when the package is loaded,
  this is also opt-in.

The data collected contains:

- The package version
- The error message
- The operation being performed, and the arguments
  - For the input data frames, only the structure is included (column
    types only), no column names or data

The first time the package encounters an unsupported function, data
type, or operation, instructions are printed to the console.

``` r
palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  duckplyr::as_duckplyr_tibble() %>%
  transmute(bill_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm) %>%
  head(3)
#> The duckplyr package is configured to fall back to dplyr when it encounters an
#> incompatibility. Fallback events can be collected and uploaded for analysis to
#> guide future development. By default, no data will be collected or uploaded.
#> ℹ A fallback situation just occurred. The following information would have been
#>   recorded:
#>   {"version":"0.4.1","message":"Can't convert columns of class <factor> to
#>   relational. Affected

#> → Run `duckplyr::fallback_sitrep()` to review the current settings.
#> → Run `Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = 1)` to enable fallback logging,
#>   and `Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_VERBOSE = TRUE)` in addition to enable
#>   printing of fallback situations to the console.
#> → Run `duckplyr::fallback_review()` to review the available reports, and
#>   `duckplyr::fallback_upload()` to upload them.
#> ℹ See `?duckplyr::fallback()` for details.
#> ℹ This message will be displayed once every eight hours.

```

## How is this different from dbplyr?

The duckplyr package is a dplyr backend that uses DuckDB, a
high-performance, embeddable analytical database. It is designed to be a
fully compatible drop-in replacement for dplyr, with *exactly* the same
syntax and semantics:

- Input and output are data frames or tibbles.
- All dplyr verbs are supported, with fallback.
- All R data types and functions are supported, with fallback.
- No SQL is generated.

The dbplyr package is a dplyr backend that connects to SQL databases,
and is designed to work with various databases that support SQL,
including DuckDB. Data must be copied into and collected from the
database, and the syntax and semantics are similar but not identical to
plain dplyr.
