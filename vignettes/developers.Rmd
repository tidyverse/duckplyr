This vignette demonstrates how to use duckplyr selectively, for individual data frames or for other packages.

```{r attach}
library(conflicted)
library(dplyr)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
```

## External data frame

To enable duckplyr for individual data frames instead of session-wide,

- do *not* load duckplyr with `library()`.
- use `duckplyr::as_duckdb_tibble()` as the first step in your pipe, without attaching the package.

```{r}
lazy <-
  duckplyr::flights_df() |>
  duckplyr::as_duckdb_tibble() |>
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(dep_delay)) |>
  mutate(inflight_delay = arr_delay - dep_delay) |>
  summarize(
    .by = c(year, month),
    mean_inflight_delay = mean(inflight_delay),
    median_inflight_delay = median(inflight_delay),
  ) |>
  filter(month <= 6)
```

The result is a tibble, with its own class.

```{r}
class(lazy)
names(lazy)
```

DuckDB is responsible for eventually carrying out the operations.
Despite the filter coming very late in the pipeline, it is applied to the raw data.

```{r}
lazy |>
  explain()
```

All data frame operations are supported.
Computation happens upon the first request.

```{r}
lazy$mean_inflight_delay
```

After the computation has been carried out, the results are preserved and available immediately:

```{r}
lazy
```

## Own data

Construct duckplyr frames directly with `duckplyr::duckdb_tibble()`:

```{r}
data <- duckplyr::duckdb_tibble(
  x = 1:10,
  y = 5,
  z = letters[1:10]
)
data
```


## In other packages

Like other dependencies, duckplyr must be declared in the `DESCRIPTION` file and optionally imported in the `NAMESPACE` file.
Because duckplyr does not import dplyr, it is necessary to import both packages.
The recipe below shows how to achieve this with the usethis package.

- Add dplyr as a dependency with `usethis::use_package("dplyr")`
- Add duckplyr as a dependency with `usethis::use_package("duckplyr")`
- In your code, use a pattern like `data |> duckplyr::as_duckdb_tibble() |> dplyr::filter(...)`
- To avoid the package prefix and simply write `as_duckdb_tibble()` or `filter()`:
    - Import the duckplyr function with `usethis::use_import_from("duckplyr", "as_duckdb_tibble")`
    - Import the dplyr function with `usethis::use_import_from("dplyr", "filter")`

## Prudence

The default mode for `as_duckdb_tibble()` and `duckdb_tibble()` is lavish.
This means that the dplyr operations are carried out by DuckDB when possible, and also available as data frames upon first request.
Use `as_duckdb_tibble(prudence = "frugal")` or `duckdb_tibble(.prudence = "frugal")` to avoid materializing intermediate data and to ensure that all operations are carried out by DuckDB or fail.
Prudence can also limit the number of rows or cells that are materialized:

```{r}
data <- duckplyr::duckdb_tibble(x = 1:5, .prudence = c(rows = 3))
data
```

```{r error = TRUE}
nrow(data)
```
