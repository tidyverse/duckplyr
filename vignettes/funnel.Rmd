## How is this different from dbplyr?

The duckplyr package is a dplyr backend that uses DuckDB, a high-performance, embeddable analytical database.
It is designed to be a fully compatible drop-in replacement for dplyr, with *exactly* the same syntax and semantics:

- Input and output are data frames or tibbles.
- All dplyr verbs are supported, with fallback.
- All R data types and functions are supported, with fallback.
- No SQL is generated.

The dbplyr package is a dplyr backend that connects to SQL databases, and is designed to work with various databases that support SQL, including DuckDB.
Data must be copied into and collected from the database, and the syntax and semantics are similar but not identical to plain dplyr.
