> A **drop-in replacement** for dplyr, powered by DuckDB for **fast operation**.

[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is the grammar of data manipulation in the tidyverse.
The duckplyr package will run all of your existing dplyr code with identical results, using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) where possible to compute the results faster.
In addition, you can analyze larger-than-memory datasets straight from files on your disk or from S3 storage.
If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is the [data transformation chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) in R for Data Science.


## Installation

Install duckplyr from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr")
```

You can also install the development version of duckplyr from [R-universe](https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev/builds):

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr", repos = c("https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Or from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))
pak::pak("tidyverse/duckplyr")
```


## Example

```{r attach}
library(conflicted)
library(dplyr)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
library(duckplyr)
```

Calling `library(duckplyr)` overwrites dplyr methods,
enabling duckplyr instead for the entire session. 
To turn this off, call `methods_restore()`.

See also the companion [demo repository](https://github.com/Tmonster/duckplyr_demo) for a use case with a large dataset.

This example illustrates usage of duckplyr for all data frames in the R session 
("session-wide").

Use `library(duckplyr)` or `duckplyr::methods_overwrite()` to overwrite dplyr methods and enable processing with duckdb for all data frames:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
duckplyr::methods_overwrite()
```


```{r echo = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = 0)
```

```{r}
out <-
  palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  # CAVEAT: factor columns are not supported yet
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character)) %>%
  mutate(bill_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(.by = c(species, sex), mean_bill_area = mean(bill_area)) %>%
  filter(species != "Gentoo")
```

The result is a plain tibble now:

```{r}
class(out)
```

Querying the number of rows also starts the computation:

```{r}
nrow(out)
```

Restart R, or call `duckplyr::methods_restore()` to revert to the default dplyr implementation.

```{r}
duckplyr::methods_restore()
```

dplyr is active again:

```{r}
palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  # CAVEAT: factor columns are not supported yet
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character)) %>%
  mutate(bill_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(.by = c(species, sex), mean_bill_area = mean(bill_area)) %>%
  filter(species != "Gentoo")
```


## Using duckplyr in other packages

Refer to `vignette("developers", package = "duckplyr")`.

## Telemetry

We would like to guide our efforts towards improving duckplyr, focusing on the features with the most impact.
To this end, duckplyr collects and uploads telemetry data, but only if permitted by the user:

- No collection will happen unless the user explicitly opts in.
- Uploads are done upon request only.
- There is an option to automatically upload when the package is loaded, this is also opt-in.

The data collected contains:

- The package version
- The error message
- The operation being performed, and the arguments
    - For the input data frames, only the structure is included (column types only), no column names or data

The first time the package encounters an unsupported function, data type, or operation, instructions are printed to the console.

```{r echo = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = "")
```

```{r}
palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  duckplyr::as_duckplyr_tibble() %>%
  transmute(bill_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm) %>%
  head(3)
```

## How is this different from dbplyr?

The duckplyr package is a dplyr backend that uses DuckDB, a high-performance, embeddable analytical database.
It is designed to be a fully compatible drop-in replacement for dplyr, with *exactly* the same syntax and semantics:

- Input and output are data frames or tibbles.
- All dplyr verbs are supported, with fallback.
- All R data types and functions are supported, with fallback.
- No SQL is generated.

The dbplyr package is a dplyr backend that connects to SQL databases, and is designed to work with various databases that support SQL, including DuckDB.
Data must be copied into and collected from the database, and the syntax and semantics are similar but not identical to plain dplyr.
