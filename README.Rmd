> A **drop-in replacement** for dplyr, powered by DuckDB for **fast operation**.

[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is the grammar of data manipulation in the tidyverse.
The duckplyr package will run all of your existing dplyr code with identical results, using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) where possible to compute the results faster.
In addition, you can analyze larger-than-memory datasets straight from files on your disk or from the web.
If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is the [data transformation chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) in R for Data Science.


## Installation

Install duckplyr from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr")
```

You can also install the development version of duckplyr from [R-universe](https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev/builds):

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr", repos = c("https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Or from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidyverse/duckplyr")
```

## Drop-in replacement for dplyr

Calling `library(duckplyr)` overwrites dplyr methods, enabling duckplyr for the entire session.

```{r attach}
library(conflicted)
library(duckplyr)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Needed exactly because we use pkgload::load_all() above
# and because we want to show the "Overwriting" message
methods_overwrite()
Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = 0)
```

```{r dplyr}
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
```

The following code aggregates the inflight delay by year and month for the first half of the year.
We use a variant of the `nycflights13::flights` dataset, where the timezone has been set to UTC to work around a current limitation of duckplyr, see `vignette("limits.html")`.

```{r}
flights_df()

out <-
  flights_df() %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  mutate(inflight_delay = arr_delay - dep_delay) %>%
  summarize(
    .by = c(year, month),
    mean_inflight_delay = mean(inflight_delay),
    median_inflight_delay = median(inflight_delay),
  ) %>%
  filter(month <= 6)
```

The result is a plain tibble:

```{r}
class(out)
```

Nothing has been computed yet.
Querying the number of rows, or a column, starts the computation:

```{r cache = TRUE}
out$month
```

Note that, unlike dplyr, the results are not ordered, see `?config` for details.
However, once materialized, the results are stable:

```{r cache = TRUE}
out
```

Restart R, or call `duckplyr::methods_restore()` to revert to the default dplyr implementation.

```{r}
duckplyr::methods_restore()
```

## Analyzing larger-than-memory data

An extended variant of this dataset is also available for download as Parquet files.

```{r}
year <- 2022:2024
base_url <- "https://blobs.duckdb.org/flight-data-partitioned/"
files <- paste0("Year=", year, "/data_0.parquet")
urls <- paste0(base_url, files)
urls
```

Using the httpfs DuckDB extension, we can query these files directly from R, without even downloading them first.

```{r}
db_exec("INSTALL httpfs")
db_exec("LOAD httpfs")

flights <- read_parquet_duckdb(urls)
```

Unlike with local data frames, the default is to disallow automatic materialization if the result is too large.

```{r error = TRUE}
nrow(flights)
```

Queries on the remote data are executed lazily, and the results are not materialized until explicitly requested.
For printing, only the first few rows of the result are fetched.

```{r cache = TRUE}
flights
```

```{r cache = TRUE}
flights |>
  count(Year)
```

Complex queries can be executed on the remote data.
Note how only the relevant columns are fetched and the 2024 data isn't even touched, as it's not needed for the result.

```{r cache = TRUE}
out <-
  flights |>
  filter(!is.na(DepDelay), !is.na(ArrDelay)) |>
  mutate(InFlightDelay = ArrDelay - DepDelay) |>
  summarize(
    .by = c(Year, Month),
    MeanInFlightDelay = mean(InFlightDelay),
    MedianInFlightDelay = median(InFlightDelay),
  ) |>
  filter(Year < 2024)

out |>
  explain()

out |>
  print() |>
  system.time()
```

Over 10M rows analyzed in about 10 seconds over the internet, that's not bad.
Of course, working with Parquet, CSV, or JSON files downloaded locally is possible as well.
