> A **drop-in replacement** for dplyr, powered by DuckDB for **fast operation**.

[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is the grammar of data manipulation in the tidyverse.
The duckplyr package will run all of your existing dplyr code with identical results, using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) where possible to compute the results faster.
In addition, you can analyze larger-than-memory datasets straight from files on your disk or from the web.
If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is the [data transformation chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) in R for Data Science.


## Installation

Install duckplyr from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr")
```

You can also install the development version of duckplyr from [R-universe](https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev/builds):

``` r
install.packages("duckplyr", repos = c("https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Or from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidyverse/duckplyr")
```

## Drop-in replacement for dplyr

Calling `library(duckplyr)` overwrites dplyr methods, enabling duckplyr for the entire session.

```{r attach}
library(conflicted)
library(duckplyr)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Needed exactly because we use pkgload::load_all() above
# and because we want to show the "Overwriting" message
methods_overwrite()
Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = 0)
```

```{r dplyr}
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
```

The following code aggregates the inflight delay by year and month for the first half of the year.
We use a variant of the `nycflights13::flights` dataset that works around an incompatibility with duckplyr.

```{r}
flights_df()

out <-
  flights_df() %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  mutate(inflight_delay = arr_delay - dep_delay) %>%
  summarize(
    .by = c(year, month),
    mean_inflight_delay = mean(inflight_delay),
    median_inflight_delay = median(inflight_delay),
  ) %>%
  filter(month <= 6)
```

The result is a plain tibble:

```{r}
class(out)
```

Nothing has been computed yet.
Querying the number of rows, or a column, starts the computation:

```{r}
out$month
```

Note that, unlike dplyr, the results are not ordered, see `?config` for details.
However, once materialized, the results are stable:

```{r}
out
```

Restart R, or call `duckplyr::methods_restore()` to revert to the default dplyr implementation.

```{r}
duckplyr::methods_restore()
```

## Analyzing larger-than-memory data

An extended variant of this dataset is also available for download as Parquet files.

```{r}
year <- 2022:2024
base_url <- "https://blobs.duckdb.org/flight-data-partitioned/"
files <- paste0("Year=", year, "/data_0.parquet")
urls <- paste0(base_url, files)
urls
```

Using the httpfs DuckDB extension, we can query these files directly from R, without even downloading them first.

```{r}
duck_exec("INSTALL httpfs")
duck_exec("LOAD httpfs")

flights <- duck_parquet(urls)
```

Unlike with local data frames, the default is to disallow automatic materialization of the results on access.

```{r error = TRUE}
nrow(flights)
```

Queries on the remote data are executed lazily, and the results are not materialized until explicitly requested.
For printing, only the first few rows of the result are fetched.

```{r cache = TRUE}
flights
```

```{r cache = TRUE}
flights |>
  count(Year)
```

Complex queries can be executed on the remote data.
Note how only the relevant columns are fetched and the 2024 data isn't even touched, as it's not needed for the result.

```{r cache = TRUE}
out <-
  flights |>
  filter(!is.na(DepDelay), !is.na(ArrDelay)) |>
  mutate(InFlightDelay = ArrDelay - DepDelay) |>
  summarize(
    .by = c(Year, Month),
    MeanInFlightDelay = mean(InFlightDelay),
    MedianInFlightDelay = median(InFlightDelay),
  ) |>
  filter(Year < 2024)

out |>
  explain()

out |>
  print() |>
  system.time()
```

Over 10M rows analyzed in about 10 seconds over the internet, that's not bad.
Of course, working with Parquet, CSV, or JSON files downloaded locally is possible as well.


## Using duckplyr in other packages

Refer to `vignette("developers", package = "duckplyr")`.

## Telemetry

As a drop-in replacement for dplyr, duckplyr will use DuckDB for the operations only if it can, and fall back to dplyr otherwise.
A fallback will not change the correctness of the results, but it may be slower or consume more memory.
We would like to guide our efforts towards improving duckplyr, focusing on the features with the most impact.
To this end, duckplyr collects and uploads telemetry data about fallback situations, but only if permitted by the user:

- Collection is on by default, but can be turned off.
- Uploads are done upon request only.
- There is an option to automatically upload when the package is loaded, this is also opt-in.

The data collected contains:

- The package version
- The error message
- The operation being performed, and the arguments
    - For the input data frames, only the structure is included (column types only), no column names or data

```{r include = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_COLLECT = "")
Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_AUTOUPLOAD = "")
fallback_purge()
```

Fallback is silent by default, but can be made verbose.

```{r}
Sys.setenv(DUCKPLYR_FALLBACK_INFO = TRUE)
out <-
  nycflights13::flights %>%
  duckplyr::as_duckdb_tibble() %>%
  mutate(inflight_delay = arr_delay - dep_delay)
```

After logs have been collected, the upload options are displayed the next time the duckplyr package is loaded in an R session.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fallback_autoupload()
```

The `fallback_sitrep()` function describes the current configuration and the available options.


## How is this different from dbplyr?

The duckplyr package is a dplyr backend that uses DuckDB, a high-performance, embeddable analytical database.
It is designed to be a fully compatible drop-in replacement for dplyr, with *exactly* the same syntax and semantics:

- Input and output are data frames or tibbles.
- All dplyr verbs are supported, with fallback.
- All R data types and functions are supported, with fallback.
- No SQL is generated.

The dbplyr package is a dplyr backend that connects to SQL databases, and is designed to work with various databases that support SQL, including DuckDB.
Data must be copied into and collected from the database, and the syntax and semantics are similar but not identical to plain dplyr.
